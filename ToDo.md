### TODO List ###
* Replace Handler.ashx with something less barbaric eg. JSON
* Normalize the database -> eg. create Departments table
* Optimize name autocomplete query -> increase performance on bigger data sets
* Make HireDate format universal based on user culture
* Set consistent format for HireDate and DataRange
* Ensure responsiveness to height/width changes
* Use multiple filters at once
* DateRange -> implement before, after date filter
* Load select's data from db -> Grades, Managers
